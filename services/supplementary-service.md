# Supplementary Service

ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) supplementary services enhance the basic ISDN services by providing additional functionality.&#x20;

Some common ISDN supplementary services include:

* **Call Forwarding**: Redirects incoming calls to another number.
* **Call Waiting**: Alerts users of an incoming call while on another call.
* **Three-Way Calling**: Allows users to connect with two parties simultaneously.
* **Caller ID**: Displays the caller's number and/or name.

These services improve communication efficiency and flexibility for users.
