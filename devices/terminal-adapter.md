#### ISDN Terminal Adapter

An ISDN Terminal Adapter (TA) is a device that connects digital ISDN lines to traditional analog devices such as telephones, fax machines, or modems.&#x20;

Unlike a modem, which converts digital data into analog for transmission across standard phone lines, an ISDN TA directly connects devices to the digital ISDN network, enabling higher data transfer rates.&#x20;

The TA performs protocol conversion and signaling, ensuring seamless communication between digital networks and analog equipment.
