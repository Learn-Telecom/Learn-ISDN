# ISDN Router

An ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) router is a networking device that uses ISDN technology to allow for the simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network services over the traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network.&#x20;

These routers are used to connect local networks to ISDN lines, providing reliable and faster Internet connection compared to traditional modems.&#x20;

ISDN routers typically support multiple B-channels for voice and data communications, offering enhanced bandwidth options for businesses and residential users.
