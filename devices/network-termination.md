# Network Termination

ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) utilizes network termination devices to connect customer premises equipment (CPE) to the network.&#x20;

There are two primary types:

* **NT1 (Network Termination 1):** Interfaces directly with the network, converting between BRI (Basic Rate Interface) signals and digital signals suitable for the local loop.
* **NT2 (Network Termination 2):** Functions at a higher layer, managing multiple data channels and often includes routing, multiplexing, and switching functionalities.

These devices ensure proper signal transmission and network connectivity for ISDN services.
