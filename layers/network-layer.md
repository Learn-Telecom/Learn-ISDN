# Network Layer

#### ISDN Network Layer

The ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) Network Layer is responsible for the transmission of data across the ISDN network.&#x20;

It primarily follows the specifications of the ITU-T Q.931 protocol for signaling, which manages call setup, control, and termination.&#x20;

It operates at the third layer of the OSI model, handling logical and physical addressing, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating error handling and correction mechanisms.&#x20;

By leveraging both B-channels for data transfer and D-channel for signaling, the ISDN Network Layer ensures efficient and reliable communication between devices.
