# ISDN D-Channel

The ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) D-Channel is a dedicated signaling channel used for establishing and managing communication sessions.&#x20;

It handles out-of-band signaling, carrying call setup and teardown messages separate from the actual voice or data transmission.&#x20;

Typically, the D-Channel operates at 16 kbps in Basic Rate Interface (BRI) configurations and 64 kbps in Primary Rate Interface (PRI) setups.&#x20;

This separation of signaling from data channels allows for more efficient communication management and dynamic allocation of network resources.
