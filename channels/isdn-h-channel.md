In Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), the H-Channel is used for high-speed data transmission.

It is designed to provide higher bandwidth compared to B (Bearer) channels, accommodating services that require faster data rates.&#x20;

H-Channels are categorized into different types based on their capacities:

* **H0 Channel**: Offers a data rate of 384 kbps, which is created by aggregating six B-Channels.
* **H10 Channel**: Provides a data rate of 1472 kbps, achieved by aggregating 23 B-Channels.
* **H11 Channel**: Has a data rate of 1536 kbps, similar to the primary rate interface in North America.
* **H12 Channel**: Offers a data rate of 1920 kbps, used primarily in Europe.

These channels are primarily used for applications that demand substantial data throughput, such as high-quality video conferencing and large data transfers.
