# BRI - Basic Rate Interface

**Basic Rate Interface (BRI)** is a configuration for Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) that provides two 64 Kbps bearer channels (B channels) and one 16 Kbps data channel (D channel).&#x20;

The B channels are used for voice, video, or data transmission, while the D channel is used for signaling and control.&#x20;

This setup allows for simultaneous data and voice transmission, making it useful for small businesses and homes.

BRI is characterized by its relatively low cost and simplicity, making it suitable for basic digital communication needs.
